The banking industry has become increasingly competitive in recent years. Various products and services are continuously being developed to ensure customers feel comfortable and remain loyal to the bank's offerings. Massive marketing strategies and product development efforts are being implemented to align with market trends and the latest technological advancements. One of the major challenges in this context is the discontinuation of services by customers, who may switch to other banks offering more appealing services.There are numerous factors that influence customers' decisions to cease using a bank's products or services. These include the quality of service - both online and offline - as well as the level of trust, which can be affected by economic and market dynamics. The phenomenon of customers discontinuing their use of banking services is known as Customer Churn. Strategically and from a business perspective, this phenomenon can significantly impact the long-term relationship between a bank and its customers. With the increasing prevalence of social media, customer churn can also influence public perception of the bank, potentially eroding trust levels. For these reasons, understanding customer churn is critical. The goal is to identify the key factors that lead customers to discontinue the use of a bank's products and services.
